                question: "What makes a good tutor?",
                answer:
                  "Subject knowledge is a must, but being a good tutor is really about explaining difficult concepts in a way that's clear, engaging and personalised for each student. You can have three degrees in Physics, but that doesn't mean you'll be good at explaining it at GCSE level! Tutors who can empathise with their students and help them build confidence help teens unleash their potential, and we see amazing results in just a few lessons.Our tutors are from top UK unis, and because they're just a few years older, they can explain things in a way that teens find relatable. We interview all of our tutors, and only the friendliest and most knowledgeable make it on to our platform. We're very picky about it - just 1 in 8 applicants make the cut."

                question: "Which tutor is right for you?",
                answer:
                  "Before you look for a tutor, it's helpful to have a really clear idea of exactly where your child needs help - whether with a specific English Literature text, one area of Maths or their exam technique - and filter your choices accordingly. If you're not sure where they need to focus, having a chat with them or their teacher can help you work out the best place to start. In a free meeting, you can then ask the tutor any questions you like and see how well they get on with your child before deciding to book."

                question: "Why is online tutoring important?",
                answer:
                  "Online tutoring gives kids the chance to learn at their own pace and in a way that matches their learning style. Teens are often too shy to put their hand up in class - especially if they're struggling. The reassurance of one-to-one tutoring means they can ask all the questions they want, and go over topics as much as they need until they get it."

                question: "What are the benefits of online tutoring?",
                answer:
                  "One-to-one tutoring lets kids unleash their potential. Worried about learning gaps? We'll fill them in. No tutors in your area? We've got you covered. No academic confidence? No problem. Whatever your child needs help with, their tutor will guide them through tricky topics and boost their self-belief. With the personalised one-to-one support from their tutor, your child can get the grades they deserve."

              {
                question: "How much does a tutor cost?",
                answer:
                  "Our tutors set their own prices based on their experience and qualifications, starting from $25/hour at GCSE level. Most of our tutors charge between $25 and $50 an hour. You can see all the tutors who match your budget with the handy price filter on our Find a tutor page."
